### What is Biodiversity?

Biodiversity is the name we give to the variety of life on our planet, which is the result of billions of years of evolution. It includes all species of animals and plants, and the natural systems that support them. 
The US National Parks are home to a fascinating range of animals and plants, many of which are rare and protected.
However, biodiversity also refers to the ecosystems in our forests, wetlands, mountains, lakes, rivers and agricultural landscapes.
Millions of plant and animal species maintain these ecosystems, creating oxygen that we breathe, providing food for us to eat and ultimately ensuring a sustainable planet for future generations.
They are essential to human survival.

We obtained our data from Biodiversity in National Parks | Kaggle
We selected these data files to learn more about the National Parks in the US, where they are located and the species that live within them. 
When researching the data, we learnt many things including loss of plant and animal species over time has always occurred, but the current pace of extinction is roughly 1,000 times higher than the natural rate.
Reasons for this include climate change, pollution, habitat destruction, over-exploitation of natural resources, introduction of invasive species and an increase in intensive agriculture.


### Technologies: 
Python 3, Flask, SQL, Bootstrap, HTML5, CSS, JSON??....

After downloading our data, we cleaned both files by removing any columns that did not provide us with any relevant information.
We also removed any rows that had missing data.
We then used SQL to housed our cleaned information within 2 tables.

We used HTML5 and CSS to create our webpages...
For our nav bar and drop down menu, we used Bootstrap..
Javascript and Leaflet to create our visualisations... 


## Visualisations 

(include video or screen captures of visalisations...)

## Conclusions
There are 56 national park in USA  biggest national park is (Zion National Park) and  smallest national park is (Acadia National Park) .As we can see in pie chart California(CA) states have the highest biodiversity and second have Alaska(Ak)state .and third is Washington state. Dry Tortugas National Park has lowest species and Great Smoky Mountains National Park has a highest species count. Falco peregrinus is the most common species it is present in 56 parks . Biodiversity is our life . it is  our moral duty to conserve Biodiversity  as well our Environment. Long â€“term  maintenance of  species and their management requires co-operative efforts across  entire landscapes.
